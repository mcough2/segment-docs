## Getting Started

1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**, then click **Destinations** 
2. Search for **Metronome** within the Destinations Catalog and select **Metronome (Actions)**
3. Click **Configure Actions Metronome**.
4. Select the source youâ€™d like to connect to and give the destination a name
5. Enter your Metronome API Token into the Segment Connection Settings UI (save changes).

## Mapping

Your Segment events need to be mapped to the [Metronome event format](https://docs.metronome.com/getting-usage-data-into-metronome/overview/){:target="_blank"}. The five fields listed are the required fields for Metronome.

* transaction_id (string) - unique identifier for each event
* customer_id  (string) - which customer in Metronome the event applies to
* timestamp (string) - when the event happened in [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt){:target="_blank"}
* event_type (string) - the kind of event, e.g. page_view or cpu_used
* properties (object) - key/value pairs with details of the event


## Benefits of Metronome (Actions) vs Legacy Metronome Destination 
Metronome (Actions) provides the following benefits over the classic Metronome destination:

- **Streamlined Configuration**. Configure connection details on a per-event basis, rather than for the destination as a whole. 

- **Easier access to data**. The event variables picker shows you all the available data from the event you use to test the Trigger. Variables are clearly labeled to ensure they stand out from other text and markup.

- **Clearer mapping of data** Actions-based destinations enable you to define the mapping between the data Segment receives from your source, and the data Segment sends to Metronome.
